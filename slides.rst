Python is a very powerful and easy to use programming language that
emphasizes programmer time over computer time. It allows for the
programmer to use many popular programming paradigms with ease:

	- Object-Oriented
	- Purely functional
	- Imperative

This is very easy in python:

.. code-block:: python

	print('Hello, World!')
